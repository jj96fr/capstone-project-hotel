  <h1>Hotel & Spa Website Project</h1>
  <img>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>React: A JavaScript framework for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces.</li>
    <li>Tailwind CSS: A CSS library that offers a wide range of pre-defined components and customizable styles to simplify UI design.</li>
    <li>Spring Boot: A Java framework for developing robust and scalable back-end applications.</li>
    <li>Java: The main programming language used for developing the back-end logic.</li>
    <li>Database: A database was used to store information about rooms, reservations, and payment details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Homepage: The homepage welcomes users with appealing images of the hotel and spa, along with providing basic information about the hotel, its services, and benefits.</li>
    <li>Room Pages: These pages showcase a selection of available rooms, including details such as images, descriptions, prices, and maximum occupancy. Users can use the search function to filter rooms based on their desired occupancy.</li>
    <li>Reservations: This page allows users to fill out a reservation form to submit a booking request. The form requests information such as arrival date, departure date, number of guests, and any additional special requests. Once the reservation is submitted, the data is saved in the database.</li>
    <li>Payment Page: After submitting the reservation, users are redirected to a secure payment page where they can confirm the payment using an integrated payment system, such as PayPal Sandbox. Once the payment is completed, the reservation is confirmed, and the details are updated in the database.</li>
    <li>Additional Pages: The site may include additional informative pages such as "About the Hotel & Spa," "Services Offered," "Image Gallery," and "Contact." These pages provide additional details about the hotel, spa, and related services.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Instructions to Run the Application</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the project repository or download the source code.</li>
    <li>Backend (Spring Boot):
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have a functional Java development environment.</li>
        <li>Configure the database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and set the connection details in the Spring Boot application configuration file.</li>
        <li>Start the Spring Boot application to handle frontend requests and access the database.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Frontend (React with Tailwind CSS):
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed in your development environment.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the frontend project directory.</li>
        <li>Run the command "npm install" to install project dependencies.</li>
        <li>Configure the backend URL in the React code for requests to the Spring Boot server.</li>
        <li>Start the React application using the command "npm start".</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
